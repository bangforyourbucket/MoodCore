# MoodCore
You have to **unzip the file titled dist**!

You can find the software in the **dist** subfolder of this folder.

If MoodCore doesn’t open or you’re experiencing issues with running Python, please download IDLE. I’ve included it in the folder (python-3.13.3-macos11.pkg), but note that it may update.

If the version has changed, you can download the latest version from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
After installing IDLE:
	1	Go to **File** > **Open…** and select **main.py**.
	2	Once the file is open, go to **Run** > **Run Module**.
This should launch the application!

(Current version: 1.4.2)
